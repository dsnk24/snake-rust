# Snake game in Rust
This is a little **snake game I made in Rust** to get more familiar with the language, and I can definetely say I learned a lot from this endeavour and I am confident that I am more fluent with it now!
*I haven't added any comments though and I'm still a beginner so the code might be a little messy and hard to understand, sorry!*

# Dependencies and Requirements
All the dependencies are in the `Cargo.toml` file. You can easily run it and test it out by downloading the files then navigating to the folder the files are in and running `cargo run` in your terminal of choice!
